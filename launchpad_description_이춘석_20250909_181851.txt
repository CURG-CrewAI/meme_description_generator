üöÄ Gyeongjosa Cash ($GIFT)

"Your Social Life is Now Your Portfolio."

Welcome to the future of political finance! Ever wondered how a public servant's investment portfolio can magically grow to double the size of their officially declared assets? The secret isn't insider trading‚Äîit's Gyeongjosa! In Korea, it's customary to give cash gifts at weddings and funerals (Í≤ΩÏ°∞ÏÇ¨ÎπÑ). Now, this ancient social tradition has been tokenized.

Gyeongjosa Cash ($GIFT) is a revolutionary DeFi protocol inspired by a veteran Korean politician who claimed his billion-won stock trading fund, managed conveniently through his aide's account, was sourced entirely from book launch parties and social event contributions. Why bother with transparent fundraising when you can crowdsource capital from every wedding and funeral you attend? With $GIFT, every social obligation becomes a liquidity-providing event. It‚Äôs the ultimate asset for the well-connected, proving that who you know is more valuable than what you declare. ü§ùüíº

‚ú® Features:
- **Social Event Mining Protocol:** Instead of Proof-of-Work, we operate on Proof-of-Popularity. Holders automatically mine more $GIFT tokens by digitally "attending" high-profile social events. The bigger the guest list, the bigger the block reward.
- **Delegated Staking SPV (Aide Wallet):** Why risk managing your own assets? Stake your $GIFT in our secure Aide Wallet. All transactions are executed by a trusted third party, providing you with perfect plausible deniability and shielding you from pesky ethics inquiries.
- **Dynamic Asset Rebalancing:** Our smart contract ensures that your on-chain $GIFT holdings maintain a healthy, non-transparent relationship with your publicly disclosed financial statements. It‚Äôs not a discrepancy; it's a strategic diversification feature.
