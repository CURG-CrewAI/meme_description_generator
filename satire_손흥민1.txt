üöÄ LAsSON ($LASSON) Emergency Launch!

"From the Premier League to Hollywood: The Ultimate Transfer!"

Hold onto your hats, degens! South Korea's national treasure and footballing icon, Son Heung-min, has officially forked from the Tottenham Network and migrated to the Hollywood Chain! ‚òÄÔ∏è In a move that's being called the biggest transfer since Satoshi's whitepaper, LAFC paid a record-breaking "gas fee" to bring the legend to the MLS. And guess what? The new chain is already flying. Within weeks, Sonny is delivering assists, boosting commercial revenue faster than a 1000x pump, and is even scheduled to execute a "cross-chain transaction" by throwing the first pitch at a baseball game. This isn't just a player; it's a one-man bull market hitting the City of Angels. We're launching $LASSON to commemorate this legendary new chapter. Get in before the first goal! ‚öΩÔ∏èüå¥

‚ú® Features:
- **Proof-of-Assist (PoA) Consensus:** Forget Proof-of-Work. Our blockchain is validated every time Sonny creates a goal-scoring opportunity. The faster the assist, the lower the transaction fees for everyone.
- **Jersey-Pegged Liquidity:** Our LP isn't backed by boring fiat. It's algorithmically pegged to the global sales velocity of Son's #7 LAFC jersey. When shirt sales pump, we all pump. Simple tokenomics.
- **Cross-Sport Bridge Protocol:** Seamlessly bridge your $LASSON assets from the Soccer-Chain to the Baseball-Diamond-Chain. Who needs LayerZero when you've got a perfect first pitch that proves interoperability?

‚ö†Ô∏è Investment Warning:
This token's value is as unpredictable as a last-minute counter-attack. The whitepaper was drafted on a napkin at a K-Town BBQ joint. The record-breaking transfer fee was essentially our ICO, and the liquidity pool is funded entirely by cheers and high-fives. Investing in $LASSON will not guarantee you a golden boot, but it might make you feel like part of the team bus. This is not financial advice; it's fandom expressed through a decentralized, highly speculative, and probably unwise digital asset. DYOR (Do Your Own Research... and maybe just watch the game).

üìä **TOKENOMICS**
================
**Total Supply:** 7,992,070,800,000 $LASSON (A cryptographically secure number derived from his jersey number, birth year, and birth month/day: 7-1992-07-08)

**Distribution:**
*   **Team: 9%** - Vested in a smart contract that unlocks only upon receiving a public, on-camera nod of approval from his father, Son Woong-jung. This ensures our long-term development is aligned with the highest possible standards of discipline and fundamentals.
*   **Marketing: 31%** - Allocated to fund the production of "Son of Hollywood: The Golden Boot," a feature film starring Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson as Son Heung-min. A portion is also reserved for sponsoring every K-Town BBQ restaurant in Los Angeles to play his goal highlights on a continuous loop.
*   **Liquidity: 40%** - Permanently fire-walled in a PancakeSwap syrup pool. The multi-sig wallet requires 3 out of 5 signatures from: the LAFC mascot, a random taco truck owner on Venice Beach, Harry Kane, a certified Hollywood agent, and an AI-generated hologram of Son‚Äôs smile. This provides unparalleled security and cross-promotional stability.
*   **Community: 20%** - For the "Hollywood End Goal" fund. Rewards include airdrops of "First Pitch Fumble" NFTs, governance rights to vote on his post-game In-N-Out Burger order, and a lottery to win a non-speaking, walk-on role in his biopic.

**Special Features:**
*   **The Legacy Burn Protocol:** A deflationary mechanism where 0.077% of the total supply is automatically burned every time a live match commentator mentions "Tottenham," "Spurs," or "his time in London." This mechanism algorithmically severs ties to the old network, forcing the narrative and value forward.
*   **Paparazzi Staking (Proof-of-Fame):** Stake your $LASSON to earn $FLASH tokens. The APY is dynamically pegged to the weekly count of paparazzi photos published of Son in major tabloids. The more he's spotted at Erewhon, the higher the rewards for our community.
