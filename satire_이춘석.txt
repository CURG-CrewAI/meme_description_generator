üöÄ Proxy Alpha Token ($PROXY) Emergency Launch!

"[It's not insider trading, it's 'delegated research'.]"

In the fast-paced world of South Korean politics, a brilliant new financial strategy has emerged, inspiring a revolution in portfolio management. Imagine being a powerful lawmaker in charge of the nation‚Äôs future AI strategy. Now, imagine seeing some juicy AI-related stocks you just *know* are going to the moon. ü§´ The problem? Trading them yourself would look bad.

The solution? A groundbreaking peer-to-peer protocol involving your trusted legislative aide! This veteran politician was allegedly spotted managing his portfolio during a parliamentary session‚Äîbut through his aide's account. He has since admitted to the "proxy trading" part but insists that no classified, market-moving information from his high-level committee meetings was involved. It was just... good timing.

We're just celebrating this innovative approach to asset management where accountability is as decentralized as our blockchain. üìà

‚ú® **Features:**
-   **Delegated Staking Protocol:** You don't hold the tokens. You entrust them to a loyal "Aide Validator Node." They execute the trades, and you reap the rewards. It‚Äôs trustless, except for the part where you have to trust your aide completely.
-   **Plausible Denial Consensus Mechanism:** Our unique consensus algorithm ensures that even if a transaction is profitable right after a closed-door policy meeting, the network automatically validates the reason as "just a lucky guess." All insider knowledge is purely coincidental.
-   **Predictive Policy Oracle:** The tokenomics are directly linked to our AI-powered oracle, which scans parliamentary committee schedules to predict which sectors will be "discussed" next. Holders get early signals, which are definitely not based on non-public information.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Investment Warning:**
This token is a work of political satire and should not be considered a serious financial instrument. Our whitepaper is a redacted copy of a parliamentary hearing transcript. The liquidity pool is backed entirely by public apologies and firm denials. Investing in $PROXY will not grant you access to state secrets, but it might give you a good laugh while you watch the political drama unfold. This is not financial advice; this is performance art. Please DYOR (Do Your Own Research, but maybe don't look too closely at our on-chain history).
