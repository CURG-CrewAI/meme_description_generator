üìä **TOKENOMICS**
================
**Total Supply:** 777,777,777,777,777 $GB2H (A tribute to his lucky number 7, repeated for exponential luck)

**Distribution:**
*   **Team: 7%** - Locked in a smart contract that only vests after Son Heung-min scores his first hat-trick for LAFC. This aligns our incentives and ensures the development team remains as patient and hopeful as a Spurs fan waiting for a trophy.
*   **Marketing: 33%** - Funds allocated for our "Sunset Boulevard Blitz" campaign. This includes renting digital billboards to display a 24/7 loop of his camera celebration, sponsoring a reality TV show to find his best Hollywood look-alike, and air-dropping tokens to every celebrity sitting courtside at Lakers games.
*   **Liquidity: 40%** - Permanently locked in a Uniswap v3 pool, secured by a multi-sig wallet where the private keys are held by Hugo Lloris, a random Kimchi jjigae chef in Koreatown, and a retired Premier League referee. This guarantees a deep and stable market, immune to offside decisions.
*   **Community & Ecosystem: 20%** - Reserved for "Sonny's Supporters Trust." Rewards include airdrops of exclusive "Disappointed Smile" NFTs, governance rights to vote on his next hair color, and a chance to win an all-expenses-paid trip to watch him from the bench.

**Special Features:**
*   **The VAR Burn Protocol:** In a revolutionary deflationary mechanism, every time an LAFC goal scored by Son is disallowed by VAR, 0.07% of the total supply is automatically sent to a burn address. This converts collective fan outrage into programmatic scarcity.
*   **Celebration Staking (Proof-of-Smile):** Stake your $GB2H tokens to earn $HOLLYWOOD rewards. The APY is dynamically pegged to Son's on-pitch happiness index, which is calculated algorithmically based on the width of his smile during post-match interviews. Rewards can be redeemed for a digital, autographed photo of his dad.
